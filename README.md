An Arduino-powered device that transforms a decimal number into its binary equivalent is known as a decimal to binary converter. A display can be used to see this conversion. Reading the decimal value, converting it, and displaying the binary output are the steps in the process.
Main Components:
Serial Monitor for Display:
One of the method is to use the Arduino's serial monitor to display the binary conversion.The Arduino reads a decimal number, converts it to binary, and then prints the binary number to the serial monitor. This method is useful for debugging or when a visual representation is not necessary.
Using a 4x4 Keypad for Input:
A more interactive approach involves using a 4x4 keypad for inputting decimal numbers. The Arduino reads the input from the keypad, converts the decimal number to binary, and then displays the binary number on an OLED display. This method allows users to input any decimal number and see its binary equivalent in real-time
